/* Now itâ€™s time to dive into how exactly the <Link> component works in Next.js for navigating 
between the pages:

Automatic code-splitting by route segments: Next.js automatically divides your application's code 
based on its routes. Unlike traditional React SPAs, where all code is loaded up front, Next.js 
loads only the code necessary for the current route. It optimizes the initial page load time
 because the browser downloads only the required code, improving performance.
Isolated pages: By splitting code by routes, each page becomes isolated. This means that if 
there's an error on one page, it won't affect the functionality of other pages. This feature 
enhances the reliability and robustness of your application, as errors are contained and isolated 
to specific pages.
Prefetching: Next.js takes navigation optimization further by prefetching the code for linked 
routes in production. When <Link> components are visible in the browser's viewport, Next.js
 automatically starts fetching the code for the linked route in the background. This prefetching
  process ensures that when the user selects a link, the code for the destination page is already 
  loaded, resulting in near-instant page transitions. This prefetching mechanism enhances the 
  perceived speed of your application and provides a smoother user experience. */
